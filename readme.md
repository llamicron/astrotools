# AstroTools
vartools made easy

This project aims to streamline the [VARTOOLS](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~jhartman/vartools.html) process. Vartools commands can get pretty tedious and hard to understand. This application will turn vartools commands into a form that is easier to understand. It will also format data from a predefined, compact format into the more verbose format that vartools uses. That format is documented in this [projects documentation](https://llamicron.github.io/astrotools/).

This project will also generate graphs of data from vartools and display them for easy viewing.
